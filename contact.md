### **MRES (MASTERS BY RESEARCH) BIG DATA BIOLOGY**

Join the data revolution in Biological Sciences! The Masters by Research in Big Data Biology is designed to meet the needs of the emerging data-driven quantitative biological sciences. Rapid advances in the growth and rate of accumulation of large-scale “big data” are enabling new data-driven approaches to biomedical and biological questions requiring new approaches in data science and artificial intelligence.

See more details of this new programme [here](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/courses/big-data-biology-masters-mres).

### **GRADUATE STUDENT ENQUIRIES**

We are always keen to welcome new enthusiastic (post-)graduate researchers to the laboratory.

For Masters-level research programs, we take students through the [MRes in Advanced Biological Sciences](http://www.southampton.ac.uk/biosci/postgraduate/taught_courses/mres-advanced-biological-sciences-degree.page) coordinated by Biological Sciences at the University of Southampton.

For [PhD programmes](http://www.southampton.ac.uk/biosci/postgraduate/research_degrees.page?), Biological Sciences recruits students through the [Biological Sciences Graduate School](http://www.southampton.ac.uk/biosci/postgraduate/index.page).

For **international students**, we have experience of these country-specific programmes, and will be happy to mentor students to produce competitive applications:

*   **China** ([Chinese Scholarship Council](http://en.csc.edu.cn/))

*   **India (**[Commonwealth Scholarship Commission](http://cscuk.dfid.gov.uk/))

*   **Mexico (**[CONACYT](http://www.conacyt.gob.mx))
